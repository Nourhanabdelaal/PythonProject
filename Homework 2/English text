Finance has been an important force in human life since the earliest civilisations. It is noteworthy that from barter systems to cryptocurrencies, finance has always been associated with data, such as transactions, accounts, prices, and reports. Manual approaches to processing data have been reduced in use and significance over time. Researchers and practitioners have come to prefer digitised and automated approaches for studying and analysing financial data. Financial data contain a significant amount of latent information. If the latent information were to be extracted manually from a huge corpus of data, it might take years. Advancements in text mining have made it possible to efficiently examine textual data pertaining to finance.
Text mining is a process through which the user derives high-quality information from a given piece of text.
Text mining has seen a significant increase in demand over the last few years. Coupled with big data analytics, the field of text mining is evolving continuously. Finance is one major sector that can benefit from these techniques; the analysis of large volumes of financial data is both a need and an advantage for corporates, government, and the general public. This section discusses some important and widely used techniques in the analysis of textual data in the context of finance.
